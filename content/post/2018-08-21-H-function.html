<h3>The Problem of Side Effects</h3>
<p>When I am writing <span class="math inline">\(\mathtt{R}\)</span> code, I often do stuff in the body of my script that creates undesired side effects.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># n and x constants I wish to use later
n = 100
x = pi^2/6

# lots of code
# ...

# I suddenly wish to plot something
n = 1:1000
x = 0.1
plot(n, pnorm(sqrt(n)*x), type = &quot;l&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-08-21-H-function_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Notice that <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> have been rewritten. So what should I do if I find myself in need of their original values? Then I will have to hunt down where I’ve used <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> in my script and either change the variable names or put the entire paragraph in a function.</p>
<p>It’s probably smarter to put it all in a function, as the new variable names (e.g. <code>n2</code> and <code>x2</code>) could also have important functions in the script. Since I obviously wish my function to be anonymous, my script will look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>funtion() {
  n = 1:1000
  x = 0.1
  plot(n, pnorm(sqrt(n)*x)
}()
#</code></pre>
<p>This code isn’t beautiful at all. It’s also cryptic, as it doesn’t convey the <em>purpose</em> of the function.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-solution" class="section level3">
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>To solve this problem I’ve made the <em>hide</em> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.H = function(expr) rlang::new_function(alist(), substitute(expr))()</code></pre>
<p>Here “H” is for hide, and the dot in front of it makes the function hidden, which prevents it from cluttering your environment.</p>
<p>Here’s how <code>.H</code> works: It creates a function new function and executes it. The argument list of the new function is empty, this is why <code>alist()</code> appears. The body of the function is the argument passed to <code>.H</code>, that is the purpose of <code>substitute(expr)</code>. The package <code>rlang</code> is great for these sort of things, but it’s easy to write <code>.H</code> without it. The following function is equivalent to <code>.H</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.H2 = function(expr) {
  f = function() {}
  body(f) = substitute(expr)
  f()
}</code></pre>
<p>I prefer the version using <code>rlang</code> since it is a one-liner.</p>
<p>With this function in hand, I can write</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.H({
  n = 1:1000
  x = 0.1
  plot(n, pnorm(sqrt(n)*x), type = &quot;l&quot;)
})</code></pre>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>With the function <code>.H</code> I have reached my following three goals:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plotting without side effects,</li>
<li>relatively pretty code,</li>
<li>code that is easy to understand, as <code>.H</code> is only used to avoid side effects of code that would usually be found in the body of the script.</li>
</ol>
