<p>At the Psychological Methods Discussion group, Ben Ambridge asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone - I was wondering (don’t worry, I haven’t actually done this!) what would be wrong statistically speaking with an approach where you run a frequentist t-test (or whatever) after adding each participant and stop testing participants when the p value has remained below 0.05 (or 0.001 or whatever) for - say - each of the last 20 participants. It feels like it must be wrong somehow, but why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thread, which contains several good comments, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/853552931365745/permalink/1721184561269240/">here.</a> Some of the replies mention simulations, but no simulations are actually presented. And that brings us to the purpose of this post, namely to run a small simulation study to asses what happens under Ben Ambridge’s scenario.</p>
<p>But first let’s understand the inuition behind this proposal. Consider a sequence of coin tosses. If the true probability of success is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the probability of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> successes in a row is <span class="math inline">\(p^{k}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.05\)</span>, the probability of 20 consequtive successes equals <span class="math inline">\(0.05^{20} \approx 10^-26\)</span>. So if we assume independence of the tests, a 20-ary streak gives us strong evidence against <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The counterintuition is as follows. The sequence of estimators <span class="math inline">\(T_{i}\)</span> is <em>not independent</em>. It could take a long time to throw away already obtained information, so that <span class="math inline">\(T_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{j}\)</span> become approximately independent.</p>
<p>Notice that Ben’s problem can be understood in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Scenario A</em>: The researcher decides in advance to collect at most <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples. If she observes a streak in this sample, she pops the champagne. If she doesn’t observe a streak during the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> first samples, but her last computed test statistic is significant, she contiues to sample for at most <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> steps (<span class="math inline">\(k = 20\)</span> in Ben’s example). If she obtains a significant streak in this samples, she pops the champagne.</li>
<li><em>Scenario B</em>: The same thing, expect she will never sample more than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scenario A is the most plausible one. This is because scenario B makes it<br />
possible to observe a <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span>-streak in the original sample which the researcher wouldn’t be allowed to attempt to extend to a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-streak. And problems of this nature is the a big reason why people care about sequential testing.</p>
<p>So let’s say I have an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> denoting the maximal number of participants, a sequence of test statistics <span class="math inline">\(T_{n}\)</span>, a p-value <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (typically equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span>) anda sequence of cut-off values <span class="math inline">\(c_{\alpha}(n)\)</span>. My two questions are then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the <span class="math inline">\(k_{n}\)</span> so that the probability of observing a streak of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> consecutive test statistics <span class="math inline">\(T_{i} &gt; c_{\alpha}(i)\)</span> is less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> under Scenario A?</li>
<li>The same problem under Scenario B.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I can’t simulate every possible test statistic, I employ the usual trick and assume normality everywhere and always. Hence my test statistic is a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-statistic, and my underlying problem is testing of <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \mu = 0\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \mu &gt; 0\)</span> for a normal population with known standard deviation equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Finally, my <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span>.</p>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Results are more interesting than code. Also, graphs are more interesting than tables. So here are some graphs. Scroll down for the code.</p>
<div id="first-graph-linearity" class="section level3">
<h3>First graph: Linearity</h3>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>s in this graph is the R vector <code>1:20*50</code> of evenly spaced natural numbers.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-28-stopping_files/figure-html/results-for-large-n-1.png" width="672" /> Recall the definition of <span class="math inline">\(k_{n}\)</span>: For each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, it is the required streak length to ascertain a <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span> level of the resulting test. So what can we read from this graph?</p>
<p>1.) The relationship is linear for both scenarios! 2.) For scenario A, the slope is approximately <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, which means that you will need a streak of length <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{5} \cdot n\)</span> to give the test a level of <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span>. This is quite a lot. At least the proportion is smaller for scenario B.</p>
</div>
<div id="second-graph-small-ns" class="section level3">
<h3>Second graph: Small ns</h3>
<p>Maybe you’re worried that linearity doesn’t hold for small <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>s? That’s reasonable. So here’s a graph of <span class="math inline">\(n = \{1, 2, \cdots, 50\}\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-28-stopping_files/figure-html/results-for-small-n-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The regression coefficients are slightly different now, and I suspects there’s some weak non-linearity at the start of the function <span class="math inline">\(k_{n}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="third-graph-probability-of-rejecting-the-null" class="section level3">
<h3>Third graph: Probability of rejecting the null</h3>
<p>Finally, here’s a graph of the probability of rejecting the null for different values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. I’ve taken <span class="math inline">\(n = 100\)</span> here and</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-28-stopping_files/figure-html/probability-plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What does it tell? For one, a significance level of <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span> (the red dotted line) is out of reach for scenario A. This means that you can never use the ‘scenario A’ when aiming for this significance level. Scenario B is alright though. I haven’t checked this for any other <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> than <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>.</p>

<h1>Simulating an answer in R</h1>
<p>Here’s my simulation code. I start off with a helper function for calculating streaks in a boolean (logical) vector. The examples should help you understand what it does.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; Find the cumulative maximal streak length in a vector of bools.
#&#39; 
#&#39; @param bools Logical vector.
#&#39; @return An integer vector. The \code{i}th element is the maximal streak
#&#39; length in \code{x[1:i]}.
#&#39; @example
#&#39;     bools1 = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
#&#39;     streaks(bools1) [1] 0 1 1 1 2 3 3
#&#39;     
#&#39;     bools2 = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
#&#39;     streaks(bools2) [1] 0 1 2 3 4 4 4

streaks = function(bools) {
  if(length(bools) == 0 | length(bools) == 1) return(as.integer(bools))
  
  streaks = vector(&quot;integer&quot;, length(bools))
  counter = as.integer(bools[[1]])
  streaks[[1]] = counter
  
  for(i in 2:length(bools)) {
    if(bools[[i]]) {
      counter = counter + 1
      streaks[[i]] = max(streaks[[i - 1]], counter)
    } else {
      counter = 0
      streaks[[i]] = streaks[[i - 1]]      
    }
  }
  
  streaks
  
}

<p>The <code>streaks</code> function is used to find probabilities of rejecting the null inside the following function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; Simulate a compensating sequential design
#&#39; 
#&#39; Finds the probability of falsly rejecting the null-hypothesis for a 
#&#39; compensating sequential design for each \code{k} from 1 to n.
#&#39; 
#&#39; @param n The maximal number of attempts to obtain at a success.
#&#39; @param scenario String; &quot;A&quot; for scenario A, &quot;B&quot; for scenario B.
#&#39; @param N The number of simulations.
#&#39; @param C One-sided cut-off value for the z-statistics. Defaults to ~ 1.64. 
#&#39; @return A n-ary vector of probabilites. The ith value is the probability 
#&#39; of rejecting the null-hypothesis when a streak of length n is demanded.

streak_stopping = function(n, N, C = qnorm(0.95), scenario = &quot;A&quot;) {
  
  checked = array(dim = c(N, n))

  for(i in 1:N){
    streak = streaks(cumsum(rnorm(2*n - 1, 0, 1))/sqrt(1:(2*n - 1)) &gt; C)
    if(scenario == &quot;A&quot;) {
      for(j in 1:n) {
        checked[i, j] = if(streak[n + j - 1] &gt;= j) 1 else 0
      }
    } else if(scenario == &quot;B&quot;) {
      for(j in 1:n) {
        checked[i, j] = if(streak[n] &gt;= j) 1 else 0
      }     
    }
  }
  
  colMeans(checked)
  
}</code></pre>
<p>To find the <span class="math inline">\(k_{n}\)</span>s, I used this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ks = sapply(ns, function(n) {
  which(streak_stopping(n, N, scenario = &quot;A&quot;) &lt; 0.05)[1]
})</code></pre>
