I'm Jonas Moss, a statistics PhD student at the 
[University of Oslo](http://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/). I have two
kids, two cats, and one wife. I'm interested in `R` programming, 
the replication crisis in psychology, theoretical statistics,
[effective altruism](www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org),
and rationalism Ã  la [Lesswrong](https://www.lesserwrong.com/) 
and [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/).

This blog is made in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) with 
[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html), using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the 
[Tranquilpeak theme](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme). The `.Rmd`
source files for all posts are available on GitHub.
