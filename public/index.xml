      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Jonas Moss, a statistics PhD student at the University of Oslo. I have two kids, two cats, and one wife. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in R programming, the replication crisis in psychology, theoretical statistics, effective altruism, and rationalism à la Lesswrong and Slate Star Codex.
