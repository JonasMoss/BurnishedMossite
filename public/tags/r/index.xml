      <description>The Problem of Side EffectsWhen I am writing \(\mathtt{R}\) code, I often do stuff in the body of my script that creates undesired side effects.
# n and x constants I wish to use latern = 100x = pi^2/6# lots of code# ...# I suddenly wish to plot somethingn = 1:1000x = 0.1plot(n, pnorm(sqrt(n)*x), type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;)Notice that n and x have been rewritten.</description>

      <description>At the Psychological Methods Discussion group, Ben Ambridge asked the following question:
Hi everyone - I was wondering (don’t worry, I haven’t actually done this!) what would be wrong statistically speaking with an approach where you run a frequentist t-test (or whatever) after adding each participant and stop testing participants when the p value has remained below 0.05 (or 0.001 or whatever) for - say - each of the last 20 participants.</description>
